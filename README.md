# Photometric-Stereo-System-for-Surface-Orientation-and-Reflectance-Recovery
 a photometric stereo system to compute surface normals and albedo of objects using images taken under different lighting conditions. It is divided into three parts: Sphere Localization, Light Source Analysis, Surface Reconstruction
